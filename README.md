# Hello-world
my first Repo

Hi Everyone!

My name is Walter, I'm a biology student but Im not pursuing the degree for the time being due to some inconvenients in the University I was in. For the itme being I've worked as research assistant in an NGO dedicated to rescue and conservation of wildlife in Guatemala. After being there I worked in the hostel industry for a year aproximately and managed to score two jobs as manager! After all the skills I learned and all the experiences I lived, I realized I could actually benefit from my skills with computers and with english as a second language I can not turn this oportunity down no matter what!

So let's see where this journey takes me...
